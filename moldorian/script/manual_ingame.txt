           Prologue[br]

Once upon a time, Humans and Magi were the same race.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

One day, a pair of twins were born into the Royal Family of Highlandia, which was known to possess incredible magical powers.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

The elder twin was blessed with a natural talent for magic; however, the younger twin had no magical capacity at all.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

As they both reached the age of adulthood, the younger prince left on a journey, aiming to discover the meaning to what felt like a curse. His brother thus inherited the throne.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

Time passed. The young prince made his way to the outside world and built a castle in Emaroy, becoming its king.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

Though they may have lived apart, the two brothers remained on good terms. As both kingdoms prospered, people praised them as the {Two Wise Kings}. This era lasted for seven hundred years...
[end]
#ENDMSG()

Then, for reasons unknown, those born in the outside world became known as {Humans}, while those born in Highlandia became known as {Magi}.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

Nobody knows why such a change happened. Everything about this period has vanished, just like the legend of the Two Wise Kings.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

Moldoria is a world split into two major realms: the {Human Realm} and the {Magic Realm}.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

As the name implies, the Magi, inhabitants of the Magic Realm, possess great magical powers, and are capable of controlling monsters at will.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

Even though they possess such incredible power, Humans have never had a reason to fear them. Throughout Moldoria's long history, the Magi have done nothing that would threaten the Humans' wellbeing.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

Most Humans considered the Magi some kind of ascetic monks enduring harsh daily training. As they lived in two different realms, they could coexist without bothering each other.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

The Magi shared a similar sentiment: they were unconcerned with the Humans' existence.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

That is not to say there were no relationships at all between the two realms. Throughout history, there had been Human merchants of indomitable commercial spirit who traveled to the Magic Realm, and there had been Magi who had traveled to the Human Realm to learn their culture, though that was no longer necessary after years of what was referred to as the {Magi's movement}.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

However...[br]
One day, something happened. A young girl from the village of Keuzon was taken away by a monster while she was out in the forest.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

Humans were shocked and dismayed by this incident, unable to understand why such a tragedy had happened.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

At that moment, nobody knew that it was not merely an isolated case, but the beginning of something much darker.
[end]
#ENDMSG()

Before long, the ambitions of an evil Magus would bring great peril to all of Moldoria...
[end]

       Adventure Tips[br]

Here are some tips that you may find useful during your adventure.

[end]
#ENDMSG()

* When your HP reaches 0, it's Game Over![br]

If your entire party's HP goes down to 0 in battle, you will get a Game Over and the menu screen will open. After a Game Over, you will start again from your last save.

[end]
#ENDMSG()

* You can't use items or spells if they aren't equipped![br]

In order to use items or cast spells in battle, they must be equipped beforehand. Please remember to equip them in the {Equip} menu before fighting.

[end]
#ENDMSG()

* Gathering information is the most basic of basics.[br]

Whenever you reach a new town or village, you should talk to everyone you see. That way, you'll find out what you should be doing and where you should be going next. There are some individuals you will only be able to speak to once. We recommend taking notes of important information you learn.

[end]
#ENDMSG()

* Inspect all sorts of places.[br]

You should try to check pots or any other suspicious places inside buildings by pressing Button 2. You might find something unexpected.

[end]
#ENDMSG()

* Don't be reckless.[br]

When you're low on HP, you should consider using items or spells to recover, or heading back to an inn. It would be a shame to get a Game Over only because you felt it would have been a waste to use a recovery item or spell.

[end]
#ENDMSG()

* Save frequently.[br]

Excluding battles, you can save your game anywhere, so we recommend doing so frequently. It would be a bother to lose all your progress since your last save because of a Game Over.

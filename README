This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Game Gear game Moldorian: Hikari to Yami no Sister.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC and libpng.

Get a ROM image of the original game. This should be the No-Intro verified dump.
Specifications:

  No-Intro filename: Moldorian - Hikari to Yami no Sister (Japan).gg
  CRC32:             4D5D15FB
  MD5:               95FB42E84A2B08ACCE481B0894EA3CEA
  SHA-1:             0DAD260B5357B2F61D1452BB73D8321CA53D7262

Rename it "moldorian.gg" and place it in the "moldorian" folder. Then:

$ cd moldorian
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as moldorian_en.gg.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.
